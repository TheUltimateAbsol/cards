"GearShopHead_Sdodr_Lose": "Now, why'd you have to go and win?",
"GearShopHead_Sdodr_Lose2": "So aggressive, little inkfish!
I thought we were having a
friendly little game.",
"GearShopHead_Sdodr_Sleeve": "And with that...[page break]We've played so much that I think
my aura has rubbed off on you.
These [color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff] are one way of
showing it.[page break]Now we match, my little inkfish. Be
sure to apply them to your deck.",
"GearShopHead_Sdodr_Win": "Ohhh, what's this? Did I win?",
"GearShopHead_Sdodr_Win2": "You're still a beginner on your journey
through this thing called life, my
little inkfish.",
"GearShopHead_Sleeve": "Hey, so, ummm... Thanks for, like,
always playing this game with me.[page break]I guess it'd be pretty cool if you
used these [color=0001]card sleeves [color=ffff]sometime.
I mean...if you want to.[page break]I'm kinda totally into this game
now, so maybe we can play again
sometime?",
"GearShopHead_Win": "Whoa. I guess I won.",
"GearShopHead_Win2": "Sorry. I don't wanna harsh your
vibe or anything. Guess I got lucky.",
"GearShopShoes_Draw": "We tied? That's the best! We're
equally matched! Gimme a full-force
friendship high fiiive!",
"GearShopShoes_Draw2": "But I'll definitely win next time.
BOOYAHAHAHA!",
"GearShopShoes_Fsodr_Draw": "Uhhh...what just happened?",
"GearShopShoes_Fsodr_Draw2": "Oh, we tied! That's like a win for
both of us. High-five!",
"GearShopShoes_Fsodr_Greet": "Yo! What's uuup? Oh, we're doing
Tableturf Battle?[page break]Yeah, I can do that. You wanna battle
with me?",
"GearShopShoes_Fsodr_Lose": "Whoa. Am I bad at this?",
"GearShopShoes_Fsodr_Lose2": "Haha! Sorry—that was probably too
easy for you.",
"GearShopShoes_Fsodr_Sleeve": "Hey, we've had a lot of good battles,
haven't we?[page break]It's cool. I'm into it! Not as much as
shoes, but, like...yeah. It's fun.[page break]What was I saying? Oh, yeah! I got
you something. Some [color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff].
They're like shoes for your cards!",
"GearShopShoes_Fsodr_Win": "Whoa. Am I good at this?",
"GearShopShoes_Fsodr_Win2": "Well, call me up again if you want
a game. I'll play anytime, yo!",
"GearShopShoes_Greet": "Hi, hiiiiii! I heard there was a
Tableturf Battle with my name
on it. I'm a thousand percent IN![page break]I hope you're ready to throw down,
because I am all about this Tableturf
life. Let's GOOO!",
"GearShopShoes_Lose": "Oh my gosh, I lost. But you WON!
You're so good at this!",
"GearShopShoes_Lose2": "We should play again, OK? Not just
so I can get a chance to win...but
also not NOT that! Heehee!",
"GearShopShoes_Sdodr_Draw": "Whoa, we scored samesies! Wild.",
"GearShopShoes_Sdodr_Draw2": "No winner, but no loser either.
I'm chill with that.",
"GearShopShoes_Sdodr_Greet": "Ay, duder! What's the haps, calling
me out here?[page break]Hah! Yeah, say no more. I'm down for
a game of Tableturf Battle.",
"GearShopShoes_Sdodr_Lose": "Whoa. You got me, duder. That went
way different than I thought.",
"GearShopShoes_Sdodr_Lose2": "You play hard as nails! Lemme know if
you ever want a rematch. I'd be down.",
"GearShopShoes_Sdodr_Sleeve": "Whoa...we've had a bunch of matches
now, huh? It's been good to hang
with you like this.[page break]Oh! Duder! You should have these
[color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff] to match mine.[page break]I'm stoked to see how they look on
your deck.",
"GearShopShoes_Sdodr_Win": "Hah! You picked the wrong dude to
challenge, I tell you what.",
"GearShopShoes_Sdodr_Win2": "I'm still kinda on the clock, but it's
cool. I can leave the shop hanging
till we're done here.",
"GearShopShoes_Sleeve": "Oh! Before I forget...[page break]I just wanna thank you for always
choosing me for these super-great
Tableturf Battles![page break]I feel like we're learning from each
other and having fun too. So I got
you a little something... I hope you
can use these cool [color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff]!",
"GearShopShoes_Win": "Ooo, I won! Wheee, haha! What a
fun game this is!",
"GearShopShoes_Win2": "Don't get me wrong—you were tough!
I definitely want a whole bunch of
rematches against you.",
"GoodsShop_Draw": "Huh. Tie game.",
"GoodsShop_Draw2": "That was alright. I'd play you again
sometime, if you're into that.",
"GoodsShop_Greet": "Tableturf Battle? Yeah, sure. I'm not
busy. I mean, I am, but...it's fine.",
"GoodsShop_Lose": "...Oh. Guess I lost.",
"GoodsShop_Lose2": "Welp. Now I'm bored.",
"GoodsShop_Sleeve": "Oh, right. I should give you my
[color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff], I guess...[page break]It's fine. They're all yours now, so
do whatever you want with 'em.
Store 'em, display 'em, set 'em
as your deck. Eat 'em. Whatever.[page break]Just promise you'll play me again
sometime, got it?",
"GoodsShop_Win": "Hey, I won. Neat.",
"GoodsShop_Win2": "Good luck getting better at this.
Sorry—I don't know how to say that
without sounding mean.",
"Guidance_00": "Are you ready to battle?[page break]...Oh, honey. If you thought you could
fool me, think again. You're not fresh
enough yet! Come back at [color=0001]level 4[color=ffff].[page break]Just go to the [color=0001]lobby[color=ffff], try a few [color=0001]Turf
War battles[color=ffff], and you'll be fresh as
can be in no time splat. Good luck!",
"Guidance_01": "This is the Tableturf Battle Dojo,
sweetie! I'm so pleased to have you.[page break]You're not surprised to see me
running the show here, are you?
I may not be the youngest fish in
the school, but that doesn't mean
I'm not \"with it.\"[page break]And it doesn't get any more \"it\" than
[color=0001]Tableturf Battle[color=ffff]! Simply EVERYONE is
playing it right now. Probably since
it's so easy to get a starter deck
these days...",
"Guidance_02": "Oh dear. I was so excited to see you
that I forgot to check if you were
online. And you're not! Come back
and see me after you connect to
the [color=0001]internet [color=ffff]in the [color=0001]lobby[color=ffff], OK?",
"Guidance_03": "Like this! You just got one!",
"Guidance_04": "That [color=0001]deck [color=ffff]I just gave you contains
15 cards. That's all you need to play
Tableturf Battle with anyone![page break]Now, I'm sure you're itching to get
right into a battle, but I'm afraid I
must insist that you read the manual
first. It's long, but it's filled with all
kinds of wonderful rules. Take a look!",
"Guidance_05": "All done with your homework? Great!
Don't worry if you don't understand
every single thing right now. It's a
complicated game! And experience is
the best teacher.[page break]Come back anytime you want to
give it a try, OK?",
"Hime_Draw": "Tie game, huh? I really thought I had
you there.",
"Hime_Draw2": "Next time I'm gonna cinch it! Let me
know when you wanna go again.",
"Hime_Greet": "Yo! You the one who laid down the
challenge for a card battle? You
sure you wanna set me off?[page break]Well, it's your funeral! Even when it
comes to cards, I don't get cooked...
I stay off the hook!",
"Hime_Lose": "What, I lost?! You're too good at
this, Eight!",
"Hime_Lose2": "Ah, sorry—wrong person. It's just
that you have the same vibes as
a friend of mine.",
"Hime_Sleeve": "Y'know, I don't think anyone but
Marina has ever beat me this often.[page break]You're cool enough to have these
[color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff]. They're the extra-rad
ones I use! And now they're yours.[page break]Alright, so we gonna go again
or what?",
"Hime_Win": "BOOyah! I win!",
"Hime_Win2": "Yo, don't let it get ya down. We'll go
again sometime! The most important
thing is, I had fun!",
"Hotaru_Draw": "Aw, a tie. At least a loss would have
offered some closure!",
"Hotaru_Draw2": "I guess we're pretty evenly matched.
We should definitely play again so I
don't wake up in a cold sweat thinking
about this tie...",
"Hotaru_Greet": "Oh, you want to play that card-battle
game with me? Sure, why not?[page break]Let's dive right in.",
"Hotaru_Lose": "Oof. Guess I lost...",
"Hotaru_Lose2": "That was a good game though.
I have to admit, I really started
to care!",
"Hotaru_Sleeve": "Thanks for getting me into this
game, Agent 3. Turns out I love it![page break]I actually got you a little something
as a thank-you. Just some new
Squid Sisters merch...a set of
custom [color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff]![page break]I hope we can play again soon.",
"Hotaru_Win": "Good game![group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00] You weren't expecting me
to taunt you, were you?",
"Hotaru_Win2": "I mean, I would, but there's too much
luck involved. Let's play again later
and see how it shakes out.",
"IdolA_Draw": "Oh, a tie. A TIE?!",
"IdolA_Draw2": "Not just anyone can go fin-to-fin
with me, so consider this a victory.
And keep practicing—because you
know I will be!",
"IdolA_Greet": "Oh, do I have a worthy challenger?
You seem like you might be skilled...[page break]Let's see what you've got! Pedal to
the megalodon!",
"IdolA_Lose": "ARRRGH! I lost?! You really are
good at this...",
"IdolA_Lose2": "You have to grant me the honor of
a rematch. It doesn't have to be now,
but PLEASE! Let me redeem myself!",
"IdolA_Sleeve": "One more thing, Agent 3. You've been
a worthy and satisfying opponent to
battle...again and again.[page break]I offer my thanks on behalf of
Deep Cut...and a little something as
a token of my appreciation. I hope
you can put these [color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff]
to good use.[page break]Until next time!",
"IdolA_Win": "Yesss! I win!",
"IdolA_Win2": "...Ahem. Of course I won. But you
put up a good fight. Rematch soon?",
"IdolB_Draw": "Whoa, a tie! You're better than
I thought.",
"IdolB_Draw2": "But I know all your tricks now. The
rematch is gonna be aaaaaall mine!",
"IdolB_Greet": "You want a Tableturf Battle with
ME?! You've got guts.[page break]I'm about to show you why they
call me the Tableturf Queen of
the Greenroom. No holding back!",
"IdolB_Lose": "WHAT?! That wasn't supposed to
happen...",
"IdolB_Lose2": "Or maybe it was. You are Agent 3,
after all. Oh well. Next time you're
going DOWN!",
"IdolB_Sleeve": "Y'know, I gotta thank you for all
these sizzlin' HOT games. They've
been a blast![page break]Here—these [color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff] are for you.
You totally earned 'em.",
"IdolB_Win": "See, see, see? You never stood
a chance!",
"IdolB_Win2": "Wait'll I tell Shiver and Big Man about
this. They're gonna laugh so hard.",
"IdolC_Draw": "Ay? [group=0004 type=0005 params=](A tie? Hey, I did pretty good!)",

you're not careful, I'll do it again.)",
"Iida_Draw": "Ah, so it's a tie.",
"Iida_Draw2": "Just means I've gotta try harder
next time! I'll play again anytime.",
"Iida_Greet": "Oooh, an invite to play Tableturf
Battle? Anytime![page break]Are you ready? Because even at
cards, I don't get cooked...I stay
off the hook!",
"Iida_Lose": "Oh wow! I see you're a master on the
battlefield AND at the table.",
"Iida_Lose2": "Hm? How do I know you're good in
combat, you ask? How indeed.",
"Iida_Sleeve": "Oh, I almost forgot! Do you have
a second?[page break]I wanted to thank you for all the
games, so I brought you these
[color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff]! They're just like the
ones I use.[page break]They're yours to use or not, but I
hope you at least try them out!",
"Iida_Win": "Yesss! I won one!",
"Iida_Win2": "Hee-hee, I got pretty caught up in
that game. I'd love to play again if
you're down for it!",
"JudgeJr_Draw": "Mew... (Tableturf Battle creates
curious encounters. Sometimes they
end in neither victory nor defeat...)",
"JudgeJr_Draw2": "Mew! (As long as we both understand
that this conflict was fruitless and
held no honor...then I guess it's OK
to call it a draw!)",
"JudgeJr_Greet": "Mew! ([color=0001]Tableturf Battle[color=ffff] is no game.
On this table, victory is everything.
The weak have no place here!)[page break]Mew? (Have you fully grasped the
rules? Is your [color=0001]deck [color=ffff]prepared? Then
let's put your skills to the test...)",
"JudgeJr_Lose": "Mew... (Ah. Defeat has a bitter
taste...but resentment serves as
shackles for the weak.)",
"JudgeJr_Lose2": "Mew. (Those who win are not ensured
eternal victory. Better keep your own
carelessness in check...or perhaps
you enjoy a bitter taste?)",
"JudgeJr_Sleeve": "Mew. (The use of my [color=0001]card sleeves [color=ffff]is
reserved for those who have gained
ample experience through battle...
and you have now crossed that
threshold.)[page break]Mew! (Come, then, and accept your
well-earned card sleeves! Apply them
to your deck...and flaunt them well.)",
"JudgeJr_Win": "Mew. (Ahhh. Victory is sweet, as
always, but self-satisfaction is a
fool's trap. I will not wallow.)",
"JudgeJr_Win2": "Mew! (On the other hand, there is
much to learn from defeat! So much
to reflect upon, so many skills to
improve... I envy you. Truly.)",
"Judge_Draw": "Meow... (A tie? So we're evenly
matched. I underestimated you!)",
"Judge_Draw2": "Meow! (So! Not a win, but not a loss
either. Purrrfectly respectable.
And a good learning experience!)",
"Judge_Greet": "Meow. ([color=0001]Tableturf Battle[color=ffff] is a card
game where you need to ink more
spaces than your opponent to win.)[page break]Meow! (However, there's more to
winning than just the game in front
of you. You'll need to gather enough
cards to build a strong [color=0001]deck[color=ffff]!)[page break]Meow? (But that's getting ahead of
things... Why don't we play a match?)",
"Judge_Lose": "Meow... (Grrr... Losing is so
furrrustrating!)",
"Judge_Lose2": "Meow! (You definitely have a talent
for this. But don't take my meow for
it—get out there, and show everyone
else what you can do!)",
"Judge_Sleeve": "Meow? (You know about [color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff],
right? They let you change the
designs on the backs of your
Tableturf Battle cards.)[page break]Meow. (Now! Since you seem to have
a handle on the game, I'd say you've
earned some mew card sleeves.)[page break]Meow. (Put the set you like on your
favorite deck to show off to your
opponents and make 'em jealous.
Go on—try out some card sleeves!)",
"Judge_Win": "Meow! (Well, winning isn't everything.
Sometimes it's fun just to make the
fur fly!)",
"Judge_Win2": "Meow! (Hopefully you picked up a few
tricks for your next match!)",
"Mizuta_Sdodr_Draw": "Heh. Call that one a draw.",
"Mizuta_Sdodr_Draw2": "Fair enough. It was a good game,
and that's all that matters to me.",
"Mizuta_Sdodr_Greet": "You called me up out of nowhere for
a card game? Is that normal for
people here?[page break]Well, why not. Just don't hold back.
If we're gonna play, let's play.",
"Mizuta_Sdodr_Lose": "That one goes to you.",
"Mizuta_Sdodr_Lose2": "By the way, do you know an Octoling
named Eight? It's fine if you don't.
Just seemed like you have some
things in common.",
"Mizuta_Sdodr_Sleeve": "I've played you enough now to know
that this Tableturf Battle thing is
pretty interesting.[page break]So you can have these [color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff].
Just my thanks for showing me how
folks here kill time.[page break]I'm down for a game whenever.
See you around.",
"Mizuta_Sdodr_Win": "Well, well. Looks like I win.",
"Mizuta_Sdodr_Win2": "I'm not one to get too invested in
this stuff. But winning feels nice.",
"Mother_Draw": "Ooo, ties are so frustrating, aren't
they? Knowing that it would've taken
just a liiittle bit more to win...",
"Mother_Draw2": "But it's not about winning and losing.
The most important part of Tableturf
Battle is to have fun!",
"Mother_Greet": "Oh my! You're going to play a round
with little old me?! What a thrill![page break]I should warn you, dear...I won't be
holding back. Are you ready?",
"Mother_Lose": "I lost? But that's unbelievabl...y sad.
Yes, that's it. So sad! Boohoo...",
"Mother_Lose2": "You're quite the little card battler,
aren't you? I'll have to practice if
I want to keep up...",
"Mother_Sleeve": "When we first met, you were like a
wriggling, itty-bitty baby...but look
at you now! You've come so far![page break]I suppose you've earned a little treat.
Here, dearie—take my [color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff]![page break]Let a challenger see those sleeves
in your hand, and you'll have 'em
shaking in their booties! Hee![page break]Enjoy your future battles! And keep
on winning, y'hear?",
"Mother_Win": "My goodness! I won? I WON!
In your face, dearie! Woo-hoo!",
"Mother_Win2": "Oops! Let myself get carried away.
Pay me no mind. After all, you played
a good game just now...so keep that
weak chin of yours up! Hee!",
"NPCBattle_00": "Welcome, welcome!",
"NPCBattle_01": "Are you here for— OH! Oh no.
You don't have a single deck![page break]That simply won't DO, dearie.
Here's what you're going to do now.
Open up your menu. Go to Status and
look for Tableturf Battle. Build a deck
there, and then come right back!",
"NPCBattle_02": "Who will you battle?",
"NPCBattle_03": "Oh, I'm so sorry, but it doesn't look
like they're available right now. Why
don't you try again another time?",
"NPCBattle_04": "Oh, I'm so sorry, but you can't play
against a total stranger. Why don't
you get to know them a little bit,
and then try inviting them again?",
"NPCBattle_05": "Acht? Hmm... Sorry—I don't know
who that is. But I'll ask around,
so come back and try again later!",
"Vendor_Draw": "I guess that's a tie...",
"Vendor_Draw2": "Sometimes that's just how things go,
eh, chum?",
"Vendor_Fsodr_Draw": "Wot's this? A draw?! Nil-nil?",
"Vendor_Fsodr_Draw2": "I'll take it. And you ought to as well,
mate. Not like either of us lost, so
let's call it win-win.",
"Vendor_Fsodr_Greet": "S'appening, mate?[page break]You fancy a battle wif me? Awright.
But you should know I'm rubbish
at this.",
"Vendor_Fsodr_Lose": "Oi. I lost. As expected.",
"Vendor_Fsodr_Lose2": "Not sure I'm good enough to give
you a run for your money, love.",
"Vendor_Fsodr_Sleeve": "I see wot you're doin wif this game,
mate. Really goin' for the gold,
aren't ya? Much respect.[page break]Matter of fact, I've got a li'l trifle
for ya. Here. Take these special
[color=0001]card sleeves [color=ffff]off me hands.[page break]I saw you eyein' 'em the whole time
we played, didn't I? Ah, I'm just
pulling your leg. Cheerio, love.",
"Vendor_Fsodr_Win": "Crikey, I won.",
"Vendor_Fsodr_Win2": "...You know wot? I think I got lucky.
You'll take the next one, mate.",
"Vendor_Greet": "Oi, chum! Bet you don't have what
it takes to beat me in a Tableturf
Battle. Wanna find out?",
"Vendor_Lose": "I lost?",
"Vendor_Lose2": "Not bad, chum. You've got some
surprises up your sleeve. Very cool.",
"Vendor_Sleeve": "You did real good. Like some kind
of Tableturf Battle genius in the
making.[page break]Hey, do you want these [color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff]?
I think you'll get a lot more use out
of 'em than I will.[page break]Oh, and thanks for the game, chum!",
"Vendor_Win": "See? I win.",
"Vendor_Win2": "Hey, we've all got our strengths,
right? Let's play again sometime.",
"WeaponShop_Draw": "I can't believe it—we tied!
What an unusual result.",
"WeaponShop_Draw2": "I think, by definition, this makes us
rivals. Well played, rival!",
"WeaponShop_Fsodr_Draw": "Awww, so close...",
"WeaponShop_Fsodr_Draw2": "You're as good as Sheldon!",
"WeaponShop_Fsodr_Greet": "Hi, hi! Are we gonna Tableturf
Battle? Yaaaaaay![page break]I'm pretty good, you know. I even
beat Sheldon one or two times!",
"WeaponShop_Fsodr_Lose": "Awww, I lost and I'm sad about it!
Boooo.",
"WeaponShop_Fsodr_Lose2": "But I'm not gonna lose next time.
I'll get better! So I can win! Yeaaah!",
"WeaponShop_Fsodr_Sleeve": "Ummm, I wanted to say...thanks for
playing with me! I really mean it![page break]It made me love Tableturf Battles
even more.[page break]Here are some [color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff]. Play me
again sometime, OK?",
"WeaponShop_Fsodr_Win": "Yaaay! I won! Isn't that great?!",
"WeaponShop_Fsodr_Win2": "Oh...sorry. Sheldon told me it's bad to
get too excited if I win. He called it...
um...gloating.",
"WeaponShop_Greet": "So, you know I talk a big game about
weapons, and you're wondering if I
can back it up, right?[page break]Consider what's about to happen a
lesson! I'll be using my carefully
curated deck that's absolutely
STACKED with some of the most
formidable cards in existence!",
"WeaponShop_Lose": "No! How could this happen?
I've got to do more research...",
"WeaponShop_Lose2": "Rest assured, I'll use the data from
this matchup to provide a tougher
challenge next time. Back to my
research chamber!",
"WeaponShop_Sleeve": "Thank you for being such a worthy
Tableturf Battle competitor.[page break]As a small token of my appreciation,
I got you some special [color=0001]card sleeves[color=ffff]![page break]I look forward to many more well-
fought battles with you in the future.",
"WeaponShop_Win": "Just as I predicted—I win!",
"WeaponShop_Win2": "Sorry—I don't get to battle much.
This is all I have!"

don't need to worry about

don't throw me anywhere!",

can really clear the floor.",

there's nowhere to hide from my
deadly pipes!",

Turf Drone Gauge helps some.",

when you take out fish, so having
both gives you double benefits!",

can pair it with Run Speed Up or
Swim Speed Up!",

Eight! I need to get you an
exercise wheel or something!",
"DroneCadencePaintUp_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",

lots of turf. Especially if you've
set some Main Ink Coverage chips.",

Pearl the Drone Sprinkler chip,
this lets her fill her own gauge!",

machine! Think of the damage I
could do that way!",
"DroneCadenceTimeUp_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",

drone gauge will fill faster than
paint dries.",

to go with it, she'll be giving you
assists left and right!",

building gauge unless you gimme
a chip that lets me do stuff!",

"EnemySinkUp_UnlockComment_02": "Slowing down enemies on your
turf means Poison Ink is even
more effective if you have it.",

that synchronizes nicely too!",

gonna get bogged down in this
stuff, right?",
"FarDamageRatioUp_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",
"FarDamageRatioUp_UnlockComment_02": "This goes great with chargers or
splatlings. Hit hard from far away
so they never get close.",
"FarDamageRatioUp_UnlockComment_03": "Imagine what it's like with a few
Main Range chips! Oh, except
Pearl doesn't like chargers.",
"FarDamageRatioUp_UnlockComment_04": "The thing about chargers is
I can't hit anything, and for some
reason everything can hit me!",
"HomingShot_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",

having to aim. It can be quirky,
so not everyone's a fan.",

is for you. But it can be hard to
ink turf when the shots would
rather hit enemies.",

is boring. So it gets the Pearl
seal of approval!",
"HumanMoveUp_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",
"HumanMoveUp_UnlockComment_02": "Some ground can't be inked. This
chip is situational, but when you
need it, you really need it.",

shooting too! That way, they
can't catch you and...and...",
"HumanMoveUp_UnlockComment_04": "Chill, Marina, before we all start
to panic! But yeah, I like this chip.
Move fast, keep shooting, and win!",
"InkRecoveryUp_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",
"InkRecoveryUp_UnlockComment_02": "This doesn't just refill ink faster
in swim form, by the way. It also
works while in Octoling form.",

but not out of enemies. But with
this, maybe things will be OK!",
"InkRecoveryUp_UnlockComment_04": "So with enough of these, it won't
matter if we run out? And people
will get off our case about it?",
"KnockBackUp_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",

enemies away. Might be fun to try
to knock them clean off the floor.",

give you a fighting chance! Just
remember one thing...",

Pearl!\" Name ONE time!",
"LoadingBulletUp_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",

single charge. Doesn't take up
extra ink either. Good deal.",

is a good way to get the most out
of every shot in the barrage!",

'em! Heheh, see what I did there?",

are worried about your ink levels,
this should ease your mind.",

of perks without running out of
ink all the time. Right, Pearl?",

Eight's thing, not mine! Eight's!",
"MainPaintUp_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",
"MainPaintUp_UnlockComment_02": "Claiming more turf is important in
battle. Fills your special gauge
too. I'd advise getting this one.",
"MainPaintUp_UnlockComment_03": "It combos well with Poison Ink and
Sticky Ink to turn your turf into
a damaging slog. So much fun!",
"MainPaintUp_UnlockComment_04": "Poison what? Sticky which? What
you're saying is that inking turf
leads to victory—I got that right?",
"MainShotRangeUp_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",
"MainShotRangeUp_UnlockComment_02": "It's nice for taking out far-off
enemies. Even nicer if you can
pick up Main Damage (Distant).",
"MainShotRangeUp_UnlockComment_03": "Some weapons have a bigger
spread the further they fire,
so you might also want
Shot-Spread Reduction.",
"MainShotRangeUp_UnlockComment_04": "But the whole reason I love close
combat is because I can't hit
anything over five feet away!",
"MainShotRateUp_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",

which has obvious benefits, but
you'll also use up ink faster.",

Ink-Recovery Rate helps. I also
recommend Ink-Bottle Drop!",

ink as long as you splat 'em all
first? BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!",

damage as you Dodge Roll your
way out of a tough situation.",

anywhere fast. It's extra good if
you also have Dodge Roll Attack.",

You can get as many as six in a
row if you max it out.",

Rolls for me, 'K? Dodge Roll to the
fridge! Dodge Roll to the sofa!",

about running out of ink. Keep
moving and you can keep shooting.",

chip, you can recover ink even
while keeping a charge stored.",
"MoveInkRecoverUp_UnlockComment_04": "The best part is it works with my
dualies' Dodge Rolls! Shoot, roll,
shoot, roll—it pays for itself!",
"MoveSpecialIncreaseUp_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",
"MoveSpecialIncreaseUp_UnlockComment_02": "Running or swimming triggers it,
but it works on distance traveled.
So swimming's a bit better.",
"MoveSpecialIncreaseUp_UnlockComment_03": "There's a third trigger too.
Using Pearl to glide counts as
moving for this chip!",
"MoveSpecialIncreaseUp_UnlockComment_04": "Here's my big idea, Eight. Let's fly
around to charge your special,
then drop down and let it rip!",
"NearDamageRatioUp_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",

than Ink Damage.",

when the enemies get a little too
close for comfort!",

and blast away! Nothing beats
the rush of close combat.",

always keep a Lucky Chain going
by inking the ground.",

item drops unless you splat
some enemies.",

chain, then splat everything!
Problem solved!",

Main Range, you should be able to
shoot through the biggest foes.",

whole swarm at once! That's good
news for your Lucky Chain count.",

we could get all the enemies to
line up? What if we said please?",
"PoisonInk_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",
"PoisonInk_UnlockComment_02": "It's all you need for the big, slow-
moving ones. It's even better with
Main Ink Coverage to take turf.",

much against the little fish who
leave trails of ink as they go.",

the biggest problems! Yo, Marina,
what's that look for?!",

a new charge going. Though it'll
stop your current barrage.",
"Recharge_UnlockComment_03": "Goes great with Splatling Barrage.
If you charge during a lull, you
could keep shooting forever!",

sounds like a party! Uh, assuming
nobody shows up with a charger.",
"RollerDashUp_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",
"RollerDashUp_UnlockComment_02": "You can double your speed with
enough of these. You'd practically
be a blur on the battlefield.",

swimming! Careful, Eight. Don't
go so fast you run off the edge!",

faster—Drone Me or Eight! Last
one there's a rotten fish!",
"SaberStepAttack_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",
"SaberStepAttack_UnlockComment_02": "This adds an area effect to the
lunge attack. Tilt [group=0003 type=004b params=48 e1 3a 3f fe ff ff ff] forward
during a charged [group=0003 type=0050 params=00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00] slash.",
"SaberStepAttack_UnlockComment_03": "It's three attacks in one! The hit
with the splatana, the ink it gives off,
and now the lunge itself does damage
too. Works great on portals!",

attack lands! Let's go find some
suckers to practice on, Eight!",
"ShelterNakedTimeSave_UnlockComment_00": "Haven't seen this color chip yet.",

accident! Not me. Other people.",

any sharpshooters will love this!",

OK if you like to be precise, but if
you'd rather make a mess, pass.",

think of you getting cornered...",

is a good chip to have around if
things start to look bad.",

the deal there?",

pretty good myself.",

the Spire. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]It sold some random stuff for Prlz.",

of decorations and gear and stuff. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]We should stop by

after clearing the top floor of the Spire.",

first...[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]you won't earn any Prlz at all.",

can get one of the REALLY cool ones.",

already have. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]In fact, some color chips really come into
their own once you have a few.",

so far, [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]press [group=0003 type=0048 params=00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00] for a refresher on your Palette!",

objectives or color chips and thought, \"None of these
sound good to me\"?",

options for that floor!",

it outside of the Spire!",

"Hint_SelectTip_01": "Hey, wanna know something neat? [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Each Palette has
certain [color=0004]common tones[color=ffff], which determine what color chips
you see in the Spire.",
"Hint_SelectTip_02": "To see which tones you're most likely to find for your
current Palette, just press [group=0003 type=0048 params=00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00]!",

"Phase2_00F_First04": "Yeah, because all the color chips you had got converted
into [group=0003 type=0040 params=00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00]Prlz. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]No color chips, no upgrades.",

this time?",

it has to happen sometime! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Do your best, Eight.",
"Phase2_05F_First00": "Noice! [group=0001 type=0000 params=05 00 00 00]We made it past 5F!",
"Phase2_05F_First01": "And we got [group=0003 type=0040 params=00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00]Prlz for clearing it. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]The Spire is set up
to give you some good bonuses if you can clear 5F.",

start with [group=0003 type=003f params=00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00][color=0004]500 Membux [color=ffff]on your next run.[page break]And there'll be a guaranteed [color=0004]Vending-Machine Corner[color=ffff]

to take a breather! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Not that I breathe.",

you can.",

reach Order and blast it to bits! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]You feel me, Eight?!",

Eight, and don't push your luck!",

pretty well.",
"Phase2_09F_Rnd00_01": "Well, this next floor will be the test. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]You as pumped
as I am, Eight?",

"Phase2_09F_Rnd01_01": "Yeah. But 10F is next. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]You could be in for a rough time,

eye on it, and don't get cooked!",

was that?",

What did you pick up at the end? A [group=0003 type=003e params=00 00 80 3f 00 00 00 00][color=0004]locker key[color=ffff]?",
"Phase2_10F_First02": "That's interesting. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Based on this, [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I think you'll get a
key every time you clear certain floors for the first time
with each Palette.",
"Phase2_10F_First03": "So...[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]if we clear 10F again with another Palette,
we'll get another key?",

this Palette dry of keys yet.",
"Phase2_10F_First05": "Yeah. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I expect we'll find more as we take this one
further along.",

foot on the gas, Eight!",
"Phase2_10F_Rnd02_00": "We got the sauce to beat the boss! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]This is going
pretty good so far.",

actually make it all the way!",

give us a free ride to the top.",

doesn't let up, does it?",
"Phase2_15F_First01": "How you holding up, Eight? [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]You should rest a little
before we hit the next floor.",
"Phase2_15F_First02": "I'm so sorry you have to go through all this. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]If only
Order hadn't found a way into my mind...",

Eight out from!",
"Phase2_20F_First06": "That's the place. Someone or something there took my
will away. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I was forced to DJ for it.",

to restore the minds of \"sanitized\" Octarians like you.[page break]And since we're having this conversation, [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]that means it
must've worked!",
"Phase2_20F_First11": "Huh. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]So that was you, was it? [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]I'm racking up quite
the debt.",
"Phase2_20F_First12": "All this is even more reason to take back the Memverse
from Order. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Those other Octolings need help too!",

the top, huh?",

just yet.",

draining all the color from the Memverse!",

and reclaim Marina's hack town! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I mean, Memverse.",

forward to it.",

Yo, Eight! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Let's floor it all the way to the end!",

GOTTA be getting close now.",

"Phase2_25F_First02": "Awww yeah! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Shouldn't be long before we get this
wrapped up. Then it's back to our world tour!",

Eight are more than welcome to come see one!",

on a plane before.",

out there with you, Eight.",

mind once it's set.",

There shouldn't be a problem.",

"Phase2_29F_First08": "Alright, I can see when I'm outvoted. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]No big blazes
of glory though, OK?",

"Phase2_29F_First10": "You coming too, Acht?",
"Phase2_29F_First11": "Nah. I'd rather not get in your way. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]I'll watch from here
in case things go south.",

keep Marina safe!",

messy FIGHT!",

last time.",

for sure this time!",

Order again.",

something I can do to help.",

to us, OK?",
"Phase2_29F_Rnd01_03": "It's all yours. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]I wouldn't do you much good out there,
so I'll stay here to keep an eye on things.",
"Phase2_29F_Rnd01_04": "Roger that! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]OK, Eight, let's finish this!",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_00_00": "How come you're so glued to that laptop all the time?[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]
What are you doing?",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_00_01": "It's complicated. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]But basically, to keep my hacks for
you working, [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I'm constantly fighting with Order over
control of the Spire's systems.",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_00_02": "Like just now, it looked like the root password was about
to be reset. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]And if the admin got back the system for
[size=75%]decentralizing permissions, our access would mumble mutter mumble...[size=100%]",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_00_03": "Maybe...[group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]we should ask fewer questions.",

"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_01_01": "Hooraaay!",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_01_02": "I'm feeling like my normal take-no-prisoners self again.[group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]
Maybe it's 'cause I got Marina back?",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_01_03": "Eight, Acht, thank you SO much for freeing me. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]I need
to figure out how to repay the favor soon.",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_01_04": "Don't worry about it. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Get me out of here, and we'll
call it even.",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_01_05": "I don't think any of us are going home until we do
something about Order. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]But after that, I'm ABSOLUTELY
going to make it up to you!",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_02_00": "I meant to say, it's been a while, Acht!",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_02_01": "You're bringing that up now? [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]But you're right. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I don't
think we've spoken since before your assignment to
that Octavio unit.",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_02_02": "This was back when Marina lived in Octo-land, right?",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_02_03": "Right. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]That was about eight years ago, wasn't it?",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_02_04": "Eight years? [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]It's really been that long?",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_02_05": "Yo, I bet you have TONS of fun Marina stories I've
never heard! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Gimme the scoop, Acht!",
"Phase2_ProgressMiddle_02_06": "Pearl! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Noooooooooooo!",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_00_00": "Acht, don't you get bored staying in the elevator?",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_00_01": "Nah. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]On its own, this elevator heads back to its
default position.",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_00_02": "Without someone to stay inside and keep watch, [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]you'd
all be trapped on the current floor. Game over.",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_00_03": "Whoa, for real?! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]No one mentioned that part!",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_00_04": "I don't know if that's the full story. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]As long as I've
known Acht, they've liked cramped spaces and leaning
against walls. Isn't that true?",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_00_05": "I don't know what you're... [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Hmm. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Now that you mention
it, there is something soothing about this elevator.",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_01_00": "Hey, Pearl. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Have we met? You seem familiar.",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_01_01": "What?! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Acht, come on! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]You can't seriously be hitting
on Pearl in front of...",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_01_02": "Nope. Relax. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]I just get the feeling I've heard Pearl's
voice before somehow.",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_01_03": "Hmmm, not sure where from. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Maybe you heard some of
my early noise tracks, before Off the Hook?",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_01_04": "Could be. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]But I don't know... I can't quite place it.",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_02_00": "I'm surprised you recognized me, Marina. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]I don't look
quite how I used to.",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_02_01": "Hm? [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Well, sure, but...[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]your voice and whole general
vibe were a dead giveaway.",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_02_02": "Mm. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Makes sense.",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_02_03": "PICS PLEASE! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]I wanna see what you two looked like
way back when!",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_02_04": "Er...[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I didn't take very much with me when I left the
Octoling world, sooo...",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_02_05": "Yeah, there's like no chance your stuff isn't in a
garbage compactor somewhere.",
"Phase2_ProgressUpper_02_06": "I figured. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Wish I'd brought some of my keepsakes and
mementos along...",
"Phase3_00F_First00": "Yo, Acht! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Keeping the world safe for elevators, I see!",
"Phase3_00F_First01": "Pearl. Eight. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]You seem ready to set out again.",
"Phase3_00F_First02": "I'm actually kind of looking forward to climbing the
Spire again with all of you!",
"Phase3_00F_First03": "We're headed for the control room at the top floor.[group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]
Can't we just push the button and go now?",
"Phase3_00F_First04": "Still no. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Remember—it goes one floor at a time.",
"Phase3_00F_Rnd00_00": "Yo, Marina! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Got any words of encouragement for us?",
"Phase3_00F_Rnd00_01": "Sure! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Uhhh...[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]go get 'em, tigerfish!",
"Phase3_00F_Rnd01_00": "Yo, Eight! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]It's all riding on you again.",
"Phase3_00F_Rnd01_01": "Not ALL. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]You'll be there backing Eight up, right?",
"Phase3_00F_Rnd02_00": "All set? [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Then let's hit it.",
"Phase3_00F_Rnd02_01": "Goooing up!",
"Phase3_05F_First00": "5F CLEARED! This party is officially ON! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]And we snagged
some Prlz too.",
"Phase3_05F_First01": "You sound pretty chipper, Pearl!",
"Phase3_05F_First02": "Yeah! Our world tour finished without a hitch, but we
haven't gotten that \"us time\" I promised! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]I wanna get
this over with so we can go have some REAL fun.",
"Phase3_05F_First03": "Oh, [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Pearlie!",
"Phase3_05F_First04": "Psst, Eight. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Are these two always like this?",
"Phase3_09F_First00": "Next is 10F, yeah? [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Which means you-know-what?",
"Phase3_09F_First01": "A boss? [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Yeah.",
"Phase3_09F_First02": "Guess not that much has changed about this place
since we beat Order.",
"Phase3_09F_First03": "Apparently not. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]I'm reluctant to mess with the system
too much, [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]since there's an issue with the Palettes.",
"Phase3_09F_First04": "Whaaatever. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]It won't be a cakewalk, but we can
handle it, no sweat. Right, Eight?!",
"Phase3_10F_First00": "We're infallible, always invaluable, worth incalculable!
We catch in fools' throats—call us un-Palette-able!",
"Phase3_10F_First01": "Hey, speaking of Palettes. We've seen ones for me and
Marina...[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00] Do Eight and Acht have 'em too?",
"Phase3_10F_First02": "I did get a signal from one that seemed like Eight's![group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]
But...[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Acht doesn't seem to have a Palette.[page break]My guess is that when their soul got pulled into the
Memverse,[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00] it fixed onto Acht before it could get
turned into a Palette.",
"Phase3_10F_First03": "Not sure what that means. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Guess I got lucky?",
"Phase3_10F_First04": "So if Eight's Palette is in those lockers, we'll find it
eventually if we keep opening them?",
"Phase3_10F_First05": "We can't just leave Eight's soul to rot! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Let's get
busy hunting down locker keys!",
"Phase3_15F_First00": "So, that Order— [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Well, I guess it's Smollusk now.[group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]
What's it been up to since our big win?",
"Phase3_15F_First01": "I wondered about that too. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I looked into it, and I
couldn't find any sign that it left the Memverse.",
"Phase3_15F_First02": "No trace of it outside the Spire though. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Odds are
good that it's still here.",
"Phase3_15F_First03": "It doesn't have enough power to get its tentacles on
the real world anymore. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]So I don't think it's a threat
we need to worry about, exactly, but...",
"Phase3_15F_First04": "Maaan, I hope it's not up to any big schemes or
whatever. I do NOT want a rematch.",
"Phase3_15F_First05": "Don't worry. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]We're keeping an eye out for Smollusk.
It won't slip through our fingers.",
"Phase3_15F_First06": "Right. Meanwhile, you two should still focus on getting
through all the floors.",
"Phase3_15F_First07": "Can do! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Speaking of which. After you, Eight!",
"Phase3_19F_First00": "You're killing it so far, Eight! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]But be careful with
the boss fight ahead.",
"Phase3_19F_First01": "Yo, 'Rina! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]You got any secret weapons stashed that
could one-shot a boss for us?",
"Phase3_19F_First02": "Since you asked nicely... [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Want to try the prototype
Spittin' Fire Trip Wires I made while developing
the Memverse?",
"Phase3_19F_First03": "Oooh, that sounds AWESOME! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I say we bust 'em out
to blow this boss sky-high!",
"Phase3_19F_First04": "Fair warning—[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]they're a bit overtuned. My last simulation
showed an 88.8 percent chance of destroying the Spire.",
"Phase3_19F_First05": "Let's retire those trip wires before we expire.",
"Phase3_20F_First00": "That was impressive, Eight. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]How'd you get so skilled?",
"Phase3_20F_First01": "Huh. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Acht, didn't you say you came back to the
Memverse to \"confirm something\"?[page break]Was that \"something\" the secret to how Eight
got to be so good?",
"Phase3_20F_First02": "Ha! Nah. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I'm not interested in being a better soldier
or anything.",
"Phase3_20F_First03": "Hee-hee! That's for sure. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]I remember how often
you'd skip out on combat drills back at school.",
"Phase3_20F_First04": "So then, what did you wanna know?",
"Phase3_20F_First05": "Well, not to make a big deal of it, but...[group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]
You ever been to the Deepsea Metro, Pearl?",
"Phase3_20F_First06": "Whoa, where'd that come from? [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]No, I've never been.[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]
Though I got pretty close to it once...[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00] Must've been
five or so years back?",
"Phase3_20F_First07": "Oh, right! The day we went to extract Eight! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]I still

"Phase3_20F_First11": "Huh?[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00] Thanks for what? [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]And, also, you're welcome?",
"Phase3_25F_First00": "Huh...[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]we're a long way up. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Must be almost at the
top floor, yeah?",

Smollusk went!",
"Phase3_25F_First02": "Seriously?! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Ohhh no. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]We haven't seen it yet, so I bet
I know what you're gonna say.",
"Phase3_25F_First03": "I bet you're right. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Smollusk is in the control room on
the top floor.",

"Phase3_25F_First05": "I don't like this at all, but I guess we've gotta go
there anyway. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Eyes on the prize, Eight!",

"Phase3_29F_ClearedPlt00_01": "Which means another fight with Smollusk.",
"Phase3_29F_ClearedPlt00_02": "Yeah, probably. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]But I'm not worried. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]We've proven
we can do it, and we'll do it again!",
"Phase3_29F_ClearedPlt01_00": "Wow, what a run! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Next stop, top floor!",
"Phase3_29F_ClearedPlt01_01": "That Smollusk twerp is probably gonna be a pain again.[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]
But we'll deal with that when we come to it!",
"Phase3_29F_ClearedPlt01_02": "It's good to be confident. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Just don't take it too far.",

Weapons ready, Eight. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Here we go!",
"Phase3_29F_Complete00_00": "We're on a hot streak! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]And it DON'T STOP!",
"Phase3_29F_Complete00_01": "How many times do you think we've climbed the Spire?",
"Phase3_29F_Complete00_02": "Oh, I stopped keeping track a while ago.",
"Phase3_29F_Complete01_00": "One last step. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]The control room.",

"Phase3_29F_Complete01_02": "I don't think it ever leaves. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]The place must feel like
home for it!",

"Phase3_29F_Complete02_01": "I'm sure Smollusk is waiting with bated breath.",
"Phase3_29F_Complete02_02": "Yeah? You think it has lungs?",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr00_00": "Good ol' top floor. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]You think that Smollusk twerp
is here?",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr00_01": "Yeah. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Looks like it's holed up in the control room.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr00_02": "Fingers crossed it lets us reconfigure the Palette
in peace. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]But I'm not holding my breath.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr00_03": "We might have to fight that creep again.[group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]
Stay sharp, Eight!",

to stop us again.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr01_01": "Why do you think that thing's so hung up on its
\"world of order\"?",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr01_02": "Maybe if we knew where Smollusk—[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]or rather, Order—[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]
came from, we could figure that out.",

Palette, and that's it. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Lead the way, Eight!",

every single Palette?!",

This time, we're gonna make Smollusk see reason!",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr03_00": "Hey, you know how Smollusk said \"everyone helped
make the Memverse\" or whatever?[page break]I thought Marina built this place though. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]So what did
it mean, \"everyone\"?",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr03_01": "I did recruit some Octoling engineers to help with
Memverse development. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]But it can't mean them, right?",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr03_02": "There could be a connection there to Smollusk.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr03_03": "Then let's go in and ask it!",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr04_00": "So Order was born from the Memverse developers'
desire for a world that would never change?",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr04_01": "Why would anyone want that?",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr04_02": "I'm hoping Smollusk can tell us. But will it want to?",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr04_03": "I doubt this is the last we'll see of Smollusk.[group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]
Who knows? Maybe it'll feel talkative sometime.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr05_00": "Based on last time, it seems like Smollusk thinks
I \"backstabbed\" it somehow.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr05_01": "If Smollusk was born from the desires of the Memverse
devs, then it might see Marina as a parent.[page break]Here's a weird thought. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Is Smollusk acting out because
it can't get Marina to understand what it wants?",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr05_02": "So what if it is? [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]We still can't let it win!",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr05_03": "We got one job, and that's to get this Palette
reconfigured. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]So let's go do it, Eight!",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr06_00": "Smollusk's right about the Octoling world going through
a lot of rapid change these past few years.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr06_01": "I can see how the Memverse devs might have
trouble adjusting.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr06_02": "Yeah...[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I can sympathize with feeling lost or confused
when something or someone important to you changes.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr06_03": "But what's the problem if it turns out better than
before? [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Nothing! Zero problems detected!",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr06_04": "Yo, Eight! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]What do you think?",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr07_00": "Feels like we're reconfiguring Palettes at a pretty
good clip.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr07_01": "Yeah! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Keep it up, everyone!",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr07_02": "Out of all the Palettes I've detected in the Memverse,[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]
we should have reconfigured over half!",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr07_03": "SWEET! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Then let's go add one more to the pile!",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr08_00": "Wow, this was a great run. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]And look—we're already
at the top floor!",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr08_01": "Now to take care of Smollusk and reconfigure
that Palette.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr08_02": "Yo, I've lost count of how many times we've pulverized
that puny punk. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]When is it gonna throw in the towel?",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr08_03": "It could happen. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]But it probably won't.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr09_00": "That Smollusk REALLY ain't down with letting us
reconfigure the Palettes.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr09_01": "Yeah, it's weird. Our mission here doesn't even have
anything to do with it.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr09_02": "So how come it keeps getting in our way? [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Does it
want payback that bad?!",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr09_03": "Heh.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr09_04": "Yo, Acht, let us in on the joke.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr09_05": "Don't ask me. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Ask Smollusk.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr10_00": "Alright. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Last one.",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr10_01": "Once we reconfigure Eight's Palette, we can finally
rest easy!",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr10_02": "Eight, Pearl, Acht, [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I owe you all SO much!",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr10_03": "Yo, save it for when we win!",
"Phase3_29F_NotClr10_04": "First, we've gotta reconfigure Eight's Palette.[group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]
It's go time, Eight!",
"Phase3_Chat_00_00": "That weapon seems almost like part of you now.",
"Phase3_Chat_00_01": "Speaking of which, my Palette has dualies, right?[group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]
I main those, yo! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I'm happy Eight picked 'em up.",
"Phase3_Chat_00_02": "Good eye! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Each Palette is automatically set with a
weapon favored by its owner's soul.",
"Phase3_Chat_00_03": "Whoa, no way! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]That explains why yours is a brella.",
"Phase3_Chat_00_04": "This place is the first I've heard of these \"brellas.\"",
"Phase3_Chat_00_05": "Yeah, they're new! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Well, newish. They only came on
the scene a few years ago.",
"Phase3_Chat_00_06": "They open with a FWOOMP! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]And then, TA-DAAA! You get
to go KCHOW, KCHOW![group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00] They're SUPER fun!",
"Phase3_Chat_00_07": "Sounds...[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]great?",
"Phase3_Chat_01_00": "Alright. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]NOW we're in business!",
"Phase3_Chat_01_01": "I don't know about you, but I'm getting sick of seeing
Jelleton faces.",
"Phase3_Chat_01_02": "Jelletons were supposed to be like tower staff.[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]
But Order modified them to be this instead.",

"Phase3_Chat_01_04": "I dunno—these ones are pretty grody.",
"Phase3_Chat_01_05": "Ugh. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I wish you could see them the way they were
meant to be! It'd be wuv at first sight!",
"Phase3_Chat_02_00": "Hey, Acht. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Do you remember that game I made way
back when? [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]You were the only one of our classmates
who ever managed to beat it.",
"Phase3_Chat_02_01": "Oh, right, the rhythm game that ran at like 888 BPM.[group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]
Yeah, I remember now...[group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]and I'm getting nauseous
thinking about it.",
"Phase3_Chat_02_02": "I actually made an even harder sequel.",
"Phase3_Chat_02_03": "Are you kidding? [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Why? [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]I told you over and over to widen
the timing window and reduce the number of notes!",
"Phase3_Chat_02_04": "I just thought...[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]it would be boring if it was too easy.[group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]
And Pearl beat it without even blinking, so...",
"Phase3_Chat_02_05": "That thing when you hear a sound and press a button?[group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]
That was supposed to be hard?",
"Phase3_Chat_02_06": "Unbelievable.",
"Phase3_Chat_03_00": "Yo, Acht! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]You gonna let me hear any of those funny
Marina stories you got saved up?",

"Phase3_Chat_03_02": "Let me think. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]There was the time she talked to nobody
about excavators for two hours straight.",

your speeches used to be!",

I had such a blast! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]Can we do another one?",
"Phase3_Chat_04_01": "Your shows really were off the hook. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]And the crowds
were...[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]almost unnaturally enthusiastic.",
"Phase3_Chat_04_02": "You think so?! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]I wonder...",

imprinted on the unconscious minds accessing the
Memverse? [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]That can't be...but in theory...[size=75%]mumble mumble...[size=100%]",

on the folks who hear it.",

Octoling world?",

believe an elite soldier would up and vanish.",
"Phase3_Chat_05_02": "HAH! [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]That's Marina for you. When she makes up her
mind, you do NOT want to be in her way!",

I'm sorry for up and leaving without a word.",

these rotors! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]I don't care HOW good a friend they
were in the old days!",

went up and down real fast, like a theme-park ride?",

throw up.",

"Phase3_Chat_07_01": "What's up, Marina? [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Getting tired?",

you are in this drone form.",

"Phase3_Chat_08_00": "Oh NO! Nobody panic, but...[group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]I think I might've forgotten
my umbrella on the plane!",

so I'll just grab it once we're done here.",

airplane, right?",

Marina! [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]You look like a tiny little speck. It's so funny!",

"Phase3_PostBoss_00_01": "Nice moves. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Though I shouldn't be surprised.",

climbing, Eight!",

good—but not this good.",

Isn't that right, Acht?!",
"Phase3_PostBoss_02_03": "Uh...[group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]yeah. [group=0001 type=0000 params=0f 00 00 00]Absolutely.",
"Phase3_PostBoss_03_00": "Gotta say, you make that look easy. [group=0001 type=0000 params=1e 00 00 00]You don't get
nervous fighting those things?",

It will search for opponents in the area that you
throw it, and if it finds one, it will automatically

It takes longer to explode than the Splat Bombs

thrown near an enemy, it changes shape and targets
the foe, exploding on impact and splatting ink
everywhere. You can shoot down enemy torpedoes.",

thrown. It reveals the opponents' locations to
your teammates.",

mist form. Opponents caught in the mist move slower

is in the mist, the stronger the effect becomes.",

blocks enemy intrusion and attacks. Attacks from
enemies will speed up the time it takes for the wall

sprays ink. It operates at full power right when you
place it but gradually gets weaker. You can only place
